# SwarmOS — execution status

This file tracks where we are in the
[`swarmos-roadmap.md`](plan/swarmos-roadmap.md) plan. Update it at the end
of every phase.

## Current state

| Phase | Description                                           | Status |
|-------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| 0     | Repo discipline + security baseline + shared types    | **done** |
| 1     | SwarmOS Sim Kernel + endpoints + actions              | **done** |
| 2     | Console Operating Shell + routing + components        | next |
| 3     | Truth Layer (no DERIVED)                              | pending |
| 4     | Persistence (Timescale + Alembic + audit)             | pending |
| 5     | Real Adapter (MAVLink or DJI — TBD)                   | pending |
| 6     | Production OS (policy, geofence, auth, SBOM, ops)     | pending |

- [x] `frontend/eslint.config.mjs` with security plugin rules
- [x] `docker-compose.yml` digest-pinned + container hardening
- [x] `.github/workflows/lint.yml` + `test.yml` SHA-pinned + audit step +
      `permissions: contents: read`
- [x] `.github/dependabot.yml`
- [x] `.github/workflows/dependency-review.yml`
- [x] `.github/workflows/secret-scanning.yml` (gitleaks)

      9.0.3+ (CVE-2025-71176 fix)
- [x] `Makefile` `audit` target (pip-audit + pnpm audit + bandit)
- [x] `README.md` security section + links to CLAUDE.md and plan
- [x] Tests added: `test_messages_v1.py`, `test_voice.py`,
      `test_geometry_sectors.py`, `backend/tests/test_security.py`
- [x] Fuzz tests scaffold under `tests/fuzz/test_messages_fuzz.py`
- [x] `make lint` (ruff + mypy) green
- [x] `make test` green: 165 passed, 16 skipped
- [x] `pip-audit --skip-editable` clean
- [x] `bandit` clean (no medium+ issues across 4 059 LOC)
- [x] Voice audit grep returns zero hits
- [x] Brand audit grep returns only allowlisted hairline/dot-glow tokens

## Phase 1 — completed checklist

- [x] Added `swarm_os/` in-memory Sim Kernel:
      `state.py`, `fsm.py`, `sectors.py`, `awareness.py`, `scheduler.py`,
      `event_detector.py`, `command_bus.py`, `coordinator.py`
- [x] Added simulator projection integration at `adapters/simulator/runner.py`
- [x] Projected raw `FleetState`, `Telemetry`, `Anomaly`, and
      `MissionProgress` bus messages into Console-facing `UnitState`,
      `Sector`, `AwarenessBreakdown`, `AnomalyView`, `MissionView`, and
      typed `Event` records
- [x] Added Phase 1 REST endpoints: `/session`, `/awareness`, `/docks`,
      `/sectors`, `/units`, `/missions`, view-oriented `/anomalies`,
      filtered `/events`
- [x] Preserved legacy endpoints: `/fleet`, `/telemetry/latest`, `/events`
      fallback, and raw anomalies at `/anomalies/raw`
- [x] Added action endpoints: `/actions/verify`, `/actions/hold-patrol`,
      `/actions/dismiss`, `/actions/return`
- [x] Wired `X-Operator-Id` regex validation, per-IP/operator rate limiting,
      closed-enum `rejected_reason`, and 202 accepted command responses
- [x] Added WS dual-emission for legacy payloads plus
      `unit|dock|sector|awareness|mission|anomaly_view|event|operator`
      frames
- [x] Added targeted tests for SwarmOS mode rules, sector scoring, awareness,
      coordinator projections, command bus, snapshot endpoints, action
      validation, and 31st-call rate limiting
- [x] `make lint` green
- [x] `make test` green: 177 passed, 16 skipped; `swarm_os/` coverage ≥ 70%
- [x] `make audit` green: pip-audit clean, pnpm audit clean, Bandit no
      medium/high findings

Next: Phase 2 — Console Operating Shell. Do not start Phase 2 until the next
explicit phase request.

## Open decisions

- **Phase 5 vendor choice**: MAVLink (PX4/ArduPilot) vs DJI — to be decided
  with the user when we approach Phase 5. Either is supported by the
  adapter base.
- **Phase 5 MAVLink runtime**: MAVSDK-Python is deferred until Phase 5
  because its current protobuf pin failed Phase 0 audit on 2026-05-15.
  Re-evaluate a secure MAVLink runtime before live hardware execution.
- **Phase 6 deploy target**: Kubernetes vs compose-prod — to be decided
  based on customer requirements.
- **Phase 6 auth provider**: pure JWT vs OIDC bridge — TBD; default JWT.
